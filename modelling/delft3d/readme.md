This folder contains all boundary and initial conditions used to run all simulation with the Delft3D-FLOW

* **.ini** is the inital temperature condition file used to run the model

* **.wnd** is the wind-forcing file used to generate the basin-scale internal wave 

* **.gnd** is the numerical grid used to run all simulations

Note that there are 32 files **.ini**, one initial condition for each simulation. Wind-forcing and reservoir shape has been kept constant for all simulations.
