Here you can find all data extracted from the model to obtain physical parameters by appling it to the Interwave Analyzer (software dedicated to analyze internal waves in stratified lakes and reservoirs) 

* **.ini** is the inital temperature condition file used to run the model

* **.wnd** is the wind-forcing file used to generate the basin-scale internal wave 

* **.gnd** is the numerical grid used to run all simulations

Note that there are 32 files **.ini**, one initial condition for each simulation. Wind-forcing and reservoir shape has been kept constant for all simulations.
